            <h2>
              What is the goal of design? And how should we approach designing a
              product from the ground up?
            </h2>
            <p>
              These questions are best addressed through the lens of
              <em>Iterative Design</em> — a design philosophy that emphasizes
              building, testing, and refining through multiple stages. Rather
              than trying to create a perfect product in one go, Iterative
              Design encourages starting with rough prototypes and improving
              them gradually through feedback and evaluation. Since it's
              difficult for anyone to create a flawless design all at once, this
              philosophy utilizes trial and error as an essential part of the
              creative process, allowing us to explore a broader width of
              possible ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many ways to apply Iterative Design, but here's a simple
              workflow that captures the core idea. Between each stage, one
              should employ a variety of evaluation methods to try and improve
              upon the design:
            </p>

              <span class="highlight"
                ><strong
                  >Sketches → Low-Fidelity Wireframe → High-Fidelity Prototype →
                  Final Product</strong
                ></span
              >
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Sketches</strong>: Begin by creating as many different
                sketches as possible. The goal isn't to perfect each sketch, but
                to explore a wide range of ideas. The rougher, the better —
                focusing on core concepts helps the creator stay flexible and
                avoid getting too attached to any one sketch.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Low-Fidelity Wireframe</strong>: Review all the
                sketches, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, and then
                combine the best aspects into one or more wireframes. These
                wireframes serve as basic, structural representations of the
                product. They should convey the overall vision without getting
                bogged down in details like precise sizes or colors.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>High-Fidelity Prototype</strong>: From the wireframes,
                select the most promising design and refine it into a
                high-fidelity prototype. This version should closely resemble
                the final product — detailed enough that developers could build
                from it without needing further clarification. At this stage,
                user testing and stakeholder feedback are critical for
                validation and refinement.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Final Product</strong>: Once the prototype has been
                tested and finalized, you're ready to move forward with the
                actual product — polished, functional, and ready for launch.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To put this process into practice, we applied Iterative Design
              while building a brand-new user interface from scratch in
              collaboration with a startup: Spark AI.

            <h2>Redesigning the Spark AI Report</h2>
            <p>
              <a href="https://www.spark.ai/" target="_blank">Spark AI</a>
              is a startup that leverages artificial intelligence to provide
              meaningful insights on real-world assets—think properties, parcels
              of land, or infrastructure. One of its core products is a tool
              that helps users assess whether a piece of land is suitable for
              solar development. It does this by combining environmental data,
              zoning regulations, and satellite imagery into one
              easy-to-understand report.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the existing report interface has several usability
              issues. The content is dense, poorly structured, and
              text-heavy—making it hard for users to extract key insights. To
              address this, Spark AI invited our team of four Brown University
              students to revamp the report experience. Our mission: make it
              clearer, more engaging, and easier to act on. :)

            <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Before beginning the redesign, we wanted to understand the product
              and its users. Our team met with the founders of Spark AI to get
              an in-depth walkthrough of the current report experience.

                  Currently, this is what the report interface looks like. After
                  searching by locality, the user would receive a report of the
                  parcel.

                <figcaption>
                  The report details information such as the APN, zoning
                  jurisdiction, permitted uses, community sentiment, and more.

            </div>
            <p>
              In our meeting, we learned that the report is primarily used by
              renewable energy developers and investors to assess whether a
              piece of land is viable for a solar project. These users are
              interested in:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Zoning laws and local permitting requirements</li>
              <li>
                Community sentiment—are local residents or governments
                supportive of solar development?
              </li>
              <li>
                Precedent—have other solar projects been approved in the
                surrounding area?
              </li>
              <li>
                Credible sourcing—clear citations that verify the information
                presented
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Currently, all of this data is packed into a text-heavy report
              that's difficult to scan, navigate, or act on. The Spark team
              encouraged us to rethink the interface from a user experience
              perspective—introducing stronger visual hierarchy, more digestible
              formats (like tables, cards, or visualizations), and clearer ways
              to surface key insights.

              With that challenge in mind, each team member brainstormed and
              sketched early concepts of the report. We worked independently so
              we could explore a wider range of ideas before aligning on a
              shared design direction.

              of color, expandable cards, and a collapsible layout), we combined
              the best ideas into a low-fidelity wireframe for Spark AI. Our
              goal was to focus on layout and functionality so that the core
              vision could stand out.

                We wanted a bold title statement to make it clear to users the
                purpose of the application
              </li>
              <li>
                Kept the old sidebar on the left, while simplifying the text and
                information in the main layout of the page on the right.

              <li>
                Interactive map view allows users to click on specific parcels
                to access reports
              </li>
              <li>
                The sidebar can be collapsed to allow for a larger screen,
                allowing for a smoother user experience
              </li>
              <li>
                Color coded sentiment analysis allows users to easily find the
                information needed for the zone they are interested in
              </li>
              <li>
                The color coded document types also makes it significantly
                easier for users to narrow down the specific/relevant documents
                they would like to access to know more about the parcel of
                interest
              </li>
              <li>
                The zoning detail card can expand out for a more fleshed out
                analysis

            <ul>
              <li>
                Document diligence page shows how we plan to cluster zoning
                information together into cards, allowing users to click each
                one for further information
              </li>
              <li>
                Created the chat function near the top of the page, making it
                clear to users where to input the zoning information to get
                answers from the Spark AI
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each screen in the wireframe is designed to directly address a
              specific user need—from exploring zoning details to filtering
              documents quickly.

            <p>
              Overall, the Spark team was very supportive of the direction we're
              taking with the UI, and encouraged us to continue iterating on
              these ideas as we move toward the Hi-Fi prototype.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflecting on the sketching and wireframing process, we saw how
              each iteration helped clarify the user experience. By combining
              ideas from multiple sketches, we created a wireframe that balanced
              structure, clarity, and interaction. Still, we recognized areas
              for growth—like better content richness and clearer visual
              cues—which guided our decisions in the next phase of prototyping.
            </p>

          <section id="high-fi-prototype">
            <h2>High-Fi Prototype</h2>
            <p>
              Based on the feedback, we primarily focused on retooling the
              reports page. The primary critique we received was that our Lo-Fi
              prototype was a bit on the barebones side. The "card" dashboard
              idea was effective in making information more visually digestible,
              but it should be populated with more content.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result, we incorporated several key changes into our Hi-Fi
              prototype. We improved the content density within the report cards
              by adding relevant text for each section and introduced sentiment
              analysis to make parcel evaluation clearer and more actionable. In
              the wireframe critique, the Spark team told us to focus less on
              Document Diligence and SparkGPT features, so we omitted them in
              our Hi-Fi Prototype. Instead, we added more screens to make the
              report page fully functional.

            <h3>Design Notes</h3>
            <p>
              In making the prototype, we stuck to various design practices in
              order to produce a professional model. We used Figma layout
              features and abided by a predetermined set of fonts and styles for
              text sections and major components. We focused on alignment,
              consistent spacing, and visual hierarchy to ensure the prototype
              looked and behaved like a production-ready tool.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our prototype aims to address the startup's goal of helping users
              quickly assess zoning and parcel information by consolidating
              relevant data into an intuitive, visual format.
            </p>
            <p>
              To showcase, here are some side-by-side comparisons of our
              wireframe and prototype:

              Overall, the feedback was positive, and the Spark team wanted to
              continue working with us to iterate on our Hi-Fi prototype. Moving
              forward, we plan to expose key zoning details upfront, add a 'Past
              Projects' section, and allow users to customize the columns
              displayed in the Relevant Articles table.

              Designing for Spark AI reminded us that clarity doesn't come from
              adding more — it comes from understanding what actually matters to
              the user. Each round of iteration pushed us to cut noise,
              highlight what's essential, and question our own assumptions. Our
              prototype still has its gaps, but that's the point of iterative
              design — there's always something to improve. We're excited by
              what we've built so far, and even more excited by what's still
              left to figure out.
