            <h1>Dropdown Menu - Design Case Study</h1>
            <p>Posted on February 23, 2025</p>

            <section id="overview">
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Dropdowns are everywhere. Whether you're selecting a drink at the order kiosk, hovering over the nav bar on
                    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank" class="highlight">nytimes.com</a>
                    , or scrolling through a very long Terms of Services, these little menus are a staple in web and app design. However, as simple as it seems, designing the perfect dropdown can be tricky.</p>

                <!-- <p>It's not bad. BUT for starters, wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if you could *search* the fortunes instead of digging through text so tiny and squished you'd need a map and compass to get there? I mean, good luck finding the one where the guy is trapped in a cookie factory. And once you finally make a selection, *nothing happens*‚Äîno magic, no fortune, not even a confetti cannon. Just a plain, empty click...</p> -->

                <p>In this case study, I'll explore how different design choices affect a dropdown's usability, accessibility, and user experience. I'll compare how dropdown menus are used in three of my favorite applications ‚Äî 
                <a href="https://cab.brown.edu/" target="_blank" class="highlight">Courses @ Brown</a>, 
                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank" class="highlight">Steam</a>, and 
                <a href="https://discord.com" target="_blank" class="highlight">Discord</a>.</p>

                 <p>Before we jump in, here's a dropdown for you to play with:</p>

                <select name="dropdown-example" id="fortune-select">
                    <option value="">üç™ Click me for a fortune cookie!</option>
                    <option value="dream">A dream you have will soon become a reality.</option>
                    <option value="hardwork">Your hard work is about to pay off.</option>
                    <option value="confucious">Confucious say: He who has hope, has everything.</option>
                    <option value="joy">You will soon bring joy to someone.</option>
                    <option value="comfort">You will spend many years in comfort and material wealth.</option>
                    <option value="enterprises">Beware of all enterprises that require new clothes.</option>
                    <option value="squirrels">Beware of overambitious squirrels stealing your snacks.</option>
                    <option value="wealth">To know a person‚Äôs real wealth, ask how happy they are.</option>
                    <option value="help">Help! I'm being held prisoner in a fortune cookie factory.</option>
                </select>
            </section>

            <section id="research">
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>First, let's take a look at how dropdown menus work in different applications.</p>
                <p>I will be using the following input methods: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mouse / Trackpad</li>
                    <li>Keyboard</li>
                    <li>Mobile / Touchscreen</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Courses @ Brown</h3>
                <p>Dropdown menus in C@B are used to filter for courses by class year and department.</p>

                <div class="article-gif-container">

                    </figure>
                </div>

                <h4>Notes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Long list of options make it difficult to choose/tab through options at the bottom of the dropdown</li>
                    <li>Option has a blue background in its hovered state</li>
                    <li>Option is selected after mouse click release</li>
                    <li>Dropdown text signals the currently selected state</li>
                    <li>Dropdown selection immediately takes effect</li>
                    <li>Great screenreader compatibility - detailed instructions like 'You are currently on a menu item. To choose this menu item, press Control-Option-Space. To exit, press Escape.'</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Steam</h3>
                <p>Steam is a digital storefront for buying and playing video games. It employs a dropdown menu for game selection.</p>

                <div class="article-gif-container">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../assets/gifs/steam-games-dropdown-mouse.gif" alt="Steam Dropdown with Mouse input">

                    </figure>
                </div>

                <h4>Notes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contains a search function that allows quickly searching for
                    a game when the list is too long</li>
                    <li>Game has a light blue highlight in its hovered state</li>
                    <li>Game is selected after mouse click release</li>
                    <li>Dropdown can be collapsed by clicking the `minus` sign next
                    to `All`</li>
                    <li>Dropdown selection immediately takes effect</li>
                    <li>Focus order is hard to understand -- difficult to begin
                    tabbing through the games list as a keyboard-only user</li>
                    <li>Impossible to tab into search bar as a keyboard-only user</li>
                    <li>Poor screenreader compatibility</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Discord</h3>
                <p>Discord is a voice, video, and chat app used by people to hang out with their friends and communities. Users can update their status on Discord through a dropdown menu.</p>

                <div class="article-gif-container">

                    </figure>
                </div>

                <h4>Notes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Having only 4 status types make it easy to select/tab through
                    quickly</li>
                    <li>Inefficient - must tab through 5 layers to reach the status update
                    component</li>
                    <li>Unfriendly to error - any mistake in tabbing through the
                    components requires retabbing through them again</li>
                    <li>Dropdown text signals the currently selected state</li>
                    <li>Status has a lighter gray background in its hovered state</li>
                    <li>Status is selected after mouse click release</li>
                    <li>Must press `Save` for the status to take effect</li>
                    <li>Great screenreader compatibility - clear instructions like 'You are currently on a selectable' and 'Online, not selected'</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Focused Study: Discord 'Update Status' Dropdown</h2>
                <p>Next, let's choose one of these applications to focus on. I'll be choosing Discord and mapping out how a user may interact with its dropdown menu via mouse and keyboard:</p>
                <img src="../assets/images/default-discord-mouse-model.png" alt="Discord Status Dropdown with Mouse input state model">
                <img src="../assets/images/default-discord-keyboard-model.png" alt="Discord Status Dropdown with Keyboard input state model">

                <h3>Redesigning the Dropdown</h3>
                <p>From inspecting the state models, we'll notice there's a lot of states -- from expanding the menu, hovering over the desired status, saving the status, etc. As an improvement, maybe we can think of a way to reduce the number of states and improve the user experience?</p>
                <p>Well, what about taking out the 'Save' button after selecting a status? Without the 'Save' button, the status would automatically update as soon as it's selected in the dropdown. That would certainly improve the efficiency of this interaction!</p>
                <p>See my design below:</p>
                <img src="../assets/images/redesigned-discord.png" alt="Redesigned Discord Status Dropdown">

                <h3>Tradeoffs</h3>
                <p>However, with every redesign, there are trade-offs to consider. In this case, the redesign prioritizes efficiency, memorability, and accessibility at the cost of the interface‚Äôs learnability. While auto-saving removes friction, it may not be immediately intuitive for all users. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key trade-offs:<p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learnablity:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Less intuitive for users who have not used auto-saving interfaces</li>
                        <li>Some users may not immediately realize their status updates automatically, leading to confusion.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Memorability:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once users learn that changes apply instantly, they are likely to remember this behavior for future updates</li>
                        <li>Consistent with modern design patterns, reinforcing memorability through familiarity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Efficiency:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Removes an unnecessary step, reducing time and effort to update the status.</li>
                        <li>Eliminates frustration from forgetting to click "Save" and losing updates.</li>
                        <li>Users who frequently change their mind might prefer a "Save" button to finalize changes when they‚Äôre ready rather than triggering multiple unnecessary updates.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
                <p>Designer Kat Holmes once said, "When I think about inclusive design ... it doesn't mean we're designing one thing for all people, it means we are designing a diversity of ways for people to participate in a place with a sense of belonging."</p>
                <p>This mindset shaped my redesign of Discord‚Äôs status dropdown. From my observations of dropdowns in Steam and Courses@Brown, I found that triggering immediate state updates improved usability, efficiency, and accessibility. By removing the need for a "Save" button, my redesign streamlines status selection, reduces unnecessary steps, and makes the process more intuitive. This change not only enhances efficiency but also addresses accessibility concerns related to inefficiency and error handling.</p>

                <p>The change I implemented addresses a mismatch in our world by reducing unnecessary interactions that can be particularly difficult for users with motor impairments. By simplifying the selection process, I created a more inclusive design that accommodates users who may struggle with precise clicking or repetitive motions.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>In this case study, I discovered that mouse and touch users are often prioritized in UI design since they represent the majority of users. This can disadvantage keyboard and screen reader users, making navigation inefficient or inaccessible.</p>

                <p>For example, Steam‚Äôs lack of keyboard accessibility can severely hinder users who rely on keyboard navigation, making game selection a frustrating experience. On the other hand, Courses @ Brown‚Äôs dropdown effectively communicates with screen readers, benefiting users with visual impairments by providing detailed selection instructions.</p>

                <p>So, when we go out there and design user interfaces, let's pay attention to all input methods. :)</p>
